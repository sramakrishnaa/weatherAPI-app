# Weather App API

## Overview

This is a simple web application that allows users to get the real-time temperature information for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API. The project consists of two main parts: the API server (`apiServer.js`) responsible for handling weather data requests, and the UI server (`uiServer.js`) serving the user interface.

## Features

- Users can input a list of cities, submit the form, and receive the current temperature for each city.
- Error handling for invalid cities or API errors.
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap styling.
